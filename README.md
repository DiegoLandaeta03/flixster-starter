### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, I felt prepared to tackle react using the topics discussed in labs. However, I think we could have better gone over passing states to other components. I learned through research and trial/error, and I had to teach people how to do it or some didn't because they didn't know how.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have done the rest of the stretch goals like the sidebar. That is basically the last thing I had left.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I felt proud of my work and after looking at what others did I thought it was pretty cool all the different directions everyone took. I wanted to have the trailers ready for the demo but I got them to work following the demos. Something I implemented after noticing from a peer was a placeholder image so that all the cards still look good regardless if the API gives an image for that movie.

### Open-source libraries used

None

### Shout out

Daniel Fuentes was a big help, we would work through bugs and talk through them high level. I think us talking about react concepts together helped both of us learn and understand it a lot better. Axel was very helpful in deploying the website too!
